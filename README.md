This contains the code used to acquire video data, control the treadmill speed, and analyze fly walking

These experiments involve running fruit flies of different genetic backgrounds at different speeds and assessing the speed-dependent proprioceptive control of their walking by tracking body and leg positions in video data using DeepLabCut and Anipose.
